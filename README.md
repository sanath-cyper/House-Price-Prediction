# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, floors, etc. It is built using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Filename**: `Housing.csv`
- Contains features like:
  - `sqft_living`
  - `bedrooms`
  - `bathrooms`
  - `floors`
  - `price` (target variable)
  - and more...

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a model to predict house prices using supervised learning
- Use Linear Regression as the main algorithm
- Evaluate model performance using R² Score

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor (optional for comparison)

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

- Best R² Score: **0.68** (Linear Regression)
- The model improves with more features and clean, linear data
